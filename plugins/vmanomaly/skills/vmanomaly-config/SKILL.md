# vmanomaly configuration builder

Turn a known monitoring intent into a validated vmanomaly v1.30+ configuration. ML must earn its operational cost: first decide whether a static rule expresses the failure condition more clearly.

Read `references/model-selection.md` before selecting a model or its parameters. When producing a continuously running deployment, also read `references/deployment-readiness.md` and apply only the controls whose conditions match.

## Environment

```bash
export VM_ANOMALY_URL="https://vmanomaly.example.com"
# Use /dev/null without authentication. For authenticated instances, point this to a mode-0600
# curl config containing: header = "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
export VM_CURL_CONFIG="${VM_CURL_CONFIG:-/dev/null}"
```

Include any configured path prefix in `VM_ANOMALY_URL`. Never print or create the credential file. Ask for the URL when it is unavailable.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish intent and obtain the exact query

Collect or infer:

- the exact PromQL/MetricsQL or LogsQL expression;
- spikes, drops, level shifts, seasonal breaks, or trend breaks to detect;
- direction: `above_expected`, `below_expected`, or both;
- desired reaction time and query step;
- IANA timezone used by the production query and calendar profiles;
- known physical bounds and insignificant absolute/relative deviations;
- sensitivity preference and acceptable upper detection rate.

If the model-query field is empty but the user already supplied a query, use it for profiling and recommend placing it in the UI query input. If no query exists, ask for one. Do not invent a production query from a metric description.

When installed, `victoriametrics-query` or `victorialogs-query` may help discover names, labels, and valid expressions. Their absence must not block this skill.

### 2. Triage static alerting versus ML

Prefer a static VMAlert rule when a clear bad value exists:

| Signal shape | Better first choice |
|---|---|
| near-zero error/restart count | `> threshold for duration` |
| monotonic capacity fill | percentage threshold plus `predict_linear` |
| binary/up-down state | direct threshold, `absent()`, or `changes()` |
| expiry or hard safety limit | direct threshold |

Use vmanomaly when normal varies by time, instance, workload, or a drifting baseline; when daily, weekly, monthly, or holiday structure matters; or when a cross-series relationship is the signal. Present this decision before spending an autotune budget.

### 3. Run the runtime preflight

```bash
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/health" | jq .
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/server/buildinfo" | jq .
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/compatibility" | jq .
```

Treat the compatibility response as a preflight, not a cleanup action:

- no stored state is healthy;
- report `drop_everything`, models to purge, or reader-data cleanup;
- never delete state without explicit user approval;
- use `?version_to=X.Y.Z` for a planned upgrade.

Compatibility covers vmanomaly-managed state, supported readers, and built-in models, not custom model code, dependencies, or state; before upgrading to v1.30.3+, custom many-to-one models relying on `is_multivariate = True` must declare `topology = ModelTopology.MANY_TO_ONE`.

Only the GET compatibility check exists in v1.30.

### 4. Profile real data

Use the same `step` that the final task/config will use:

```bash
QUERY='<exact-query>'
TIMEZONE='<IANA-timezone>'
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -sG \
  --data-urlencode "query=$QUERY" \
  --data-urlencode 'start=<unix-seconds>' \
  --data-urlencode 'end=<unix-seconds>' \
  --data-urlencode 'step=5m' \
  --data-urlencode "timezone=$TIMEZONE" \
  --data-urlencode 'limit=100' \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/timeseries/characteristics" | jq .
```

Use measured trend, daily/weekly/monthly profiles, shape, eligibility, and coverage rather than guessing from the metric name. A limited result is a sample. If a limited read returns a split-chunk 422, shorten the interval or use a coarser step.

### 5. Discover and select a supported model

```bash
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/models" | jq .
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -sG \
  --data-urlencode 'model_class=temporal_envelope' \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/model/schema" | jq .
```

Use the live alias list and schema as authoritative. Rebuild the model spec when changing class; never carry stale parameters across classes.

Default hierarchy:

1. Start with `temporal_envelope` for any non-trivial temporal profile: trend, calendar patterns, holidays, persistent shifts, forecasts, or uncertainty about whether a simple stationary baseline is sufficient.
2. Use `mad_online` or `zscore_online` only when profiling confirms simple, non-seasonal, relatively stable data. Prefer MAD for skewed, heavy-tailed, or outlier-contaminated data; use Z-score only when the distribution is stable/light-tailed and standard-deviation magnitude is meaningful.
3. For aligned channels where their relationship is the anomaly, start with `temporal_envelope_multivariate`.
4. Do not introduce an offline model in the normal recommendation flow. Discuss one only when reviewing a legacy configuration, when the user explicitly requests it, or when a controlled comparison has already established a material benefit that an online model cannot provide.

### 6. Map domain knowledge to public controls

- Fix `detection_direction` when business intent is known, and map insignificant absolute/relative deviations to `min_dev_from_expected` and `min_rel_dev_from_expected`.
- In v1.30.2+ deployable YAML, place `data_range`, `detection_direction`, `min_dev_from_expected`, and `min_rel_dev_from_expected` under `reader.queries.<alias>`. Query values are authoritative across attached models; model-level values remain compatible local fallbacks but are deprecated.
- For VMUI, inspect the connected suggestion contract. When `suggest_query_config` exposes `queries` and `expected_revision`, apply complete named query rows with their aliases, enabled states and per-query policies, copying the current revision and preserving untouched rows. Null/omitted policies inherit; explicit zero, both and unbounded values override. Older single-query contracts cannot apply a named query set; do not silently drop its policies. Keep model-level defaults separate.
- Set model-level `clip_predictions` only when forecast and interval outputs should be clipped to that domain.
- Use `min_n_samples_seen` to suppress scores during cold-start; express its duration as samples multiplied by query step.
- For stable MAD, Z-score, or online-quantile data, consider `history_strength > 1` instead of many extra fit cycles; keep enough history to cover every required seasonal phase.
- Select only calendar presets supported by the profile. Temporal Envelope profiles are timezone- and DST-aware; set `reader.queries.<alias>.tz` (or the reader-level `tz`) to the same IANA timezone used during profiling.
- Keep `forecast_at` empty unless the user needs future-state forecasting or capacity planning.
- Keep multivariate `groupby`, holidays, and other domain structure fixed during autotune.

### 7. Choose direct configuration or shared autotune

For a direct configuration, begin with schema defaults and change only justified controls.

For shared autotune, first select the model class. State the trial/time budget, then create one bounded task. Use causal exact validation for online models:

```bash
jq -n --arg query "$QUERY" --arg timezone "$TIMEZONE" '{
    query:$query,
    "tuned_class_name":"temporal_envelope",
    "anomaly_percentage":0.02,
    "start":1710000000,
    "end":1711209600,
    "step":"5m",
    timezone:$timezone,
    "limit":100,
    "use_profile_hints":true,
    "optimization_params":{"n_trials":64,"timeout":30,"exact":true,"optimize_complexity":true},
    "frozen_params":{"detection_direction":"above_expected"}
  }' | curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @- \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/autotune/tasks" | jq .
```

Poll `GET /api/v1/autotune/tasks/{task_id}` sequentially. On success, use the concrete `result_data.data.modelConfig`, validate it, and test it. Do not substitute `class: auto`; that wrapper retunes during each fit and is a separate, explicitly chosen lifecycle. Autotune still returns a model spec: keep frozen business fields there for VMUI/ad-hoc testing, but move them to the corresponding query when assembling v1.30.2+ deployment YAML.

### 8. Validate and test

Validate the model spec:

```bash
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @model.json "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/model/validate" | jq .
```

Validate full YAML without applying it:

```bash
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/yaml' --data-binary @config.yaml \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/config/validate" | jq .
```

Then check capacity and run a bounded detection task using the validated model. The v1.30.3 task contract requires an explicit `datasource_url`; reuse the configured datasource URL when appropriate:

```bash
curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/anomaly_detection/limits" | jq .

DATASOURCE_URL='<configured-or-explicit-datasource-url>'
jq -n --arg query "$QUERY" --arg datasource_url "$DATASOURCE_URL" --slurpfile model model.json '{
    query:$query,
    datasource_url:$datasource_url,
    step:"5m",
    fit_window:"30d",
    fit_every:"1000w",
    start_infer_s:1710000000,
    end_infer_s:1710086400,
    exact:true,
    model_spec:$model[0]
  }' | curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @- \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/anomaly_detection/tasks" | jq .

curl -q --config "$VM_CURL_CONFIG" -s \
  "$VM_ANOMALY_URL/api/v1/anomaly_detection/tasks/<task_id>" | jq .
```

Poll the returned task ID sequentially until `done`, `error`, or `canceled`. For online models use `exact:true` and default to an effectively disabled refit cadence such as `fit_every: 1000w`, so the initial fit evolves causally during inference. Configure periodic refits only when explicitly needed.

Evaluate detections visually and against known events. Without ground-truth labels, call the observed fraction a **detection rate**, not a false-positive rate. Ask the user which detections were useful before tightening the model.

### 9. Deliver deployable artifacts

Provide:

- the static rule or complete vmanomaly YAML;
- a VMAlert rule for the produced anomaly score;
- rationale tied to profile evidence and business intent;
- query step, fit window/cadence, warmup, expected reaction time, and resource caveats;
- validation/test results and assumptions requiring production verification.
- self-monitoring integration, with the official dashboard and alert rules recommended for production rather than relying on point-in-time health checks.
- justified state restoration, retention, hot-reload, persistence, and workload-distribution choices from `references/deployment-readiness.md`.

Generated `/api/vmanomaly/config.yaml` and `/api/vmanomaly/example-alert-rule.yaml` output is a starting point, not proof of correctness. The config endpoint preserves the VMUI/model-spec compatibility shape; before presenting v1.30.2+ deployment YAML, move the four stable business policies to `reader.queries.<alias>`, add `reader.workers` when appropriate, and validate the final configuration.

## Efficient Copilot context

Reuse already available schemas, profiles and completed task results. Use focused documentation search with a small explicit top-k (usually 3–5); results may be excerpts. Check their source URI, offsets and truncation marker, then use `vmanomaly_read_doc_section` to retrieve missing context before relying on it. Do not treat excerpt omission as evidence that a parameter or limitation does not exist. Avoid repeating broad searches and full documentation in conversation history.

Show each proposed configuration once through its approval card; reserve standalone YAML for explicit export requests. Keep explanations short. Never reduce context by dropping query aliases, expressions, disabled rows, business-policy inheritance, validation constraints, or pending approval data. Named-query UI application does not imply shared named-query autotune support; inspect the actual tool schema.

The backend may compact duplicate completed tool results and enforce a local context budget independently of the provider. On a budget refusal, keep the current UI state and explain how to resume with a narrower request or a fresh conversation; do not claim an unapplied suggestion succeeded. Token ceilings are maximum output allowances, not targets. Usage counters and byte comparisons are useful for measurement but do not establish exact provider billing savings.


## Joint autotune of named queries

When the connected autotune schema exposes `queries`, send one map of active aliases to exact expressions and explicit business policies, omitting the legacy `query` field. Preserve null/omitted inheritance versus explicit zero, both and unbounded overrides. Tune the actual multivariate model class in one task and put model grouping in `frozen_params.groupby`. Each candidate is evaluated across independently fitted aligned groups, producing one shared configuration. Never merge separately tuned univariate configurations and describe the result as jointly tuned multivariate detection. The per-expression sample cap may need increasing to include matching groups from every query; incomplete groups fail explicitly.

For older servers without this contract, explain the limitation rather than silently discarding queries or their policies. Keep `anomaly_percentage` described as a tuning target, not a guaranteed anomaly or false-positive upper bound. Apply the resulting model suggestion with the existing named queries and policy state; query-local policies must not be promoted to shared defaults accidentally.

## Safety

- API validation and tasks do not deploy or hot-reload configuration.
- Obtain approval before applying configs, creating persistent alert rules, or deleting state.
- Bound samples, time ranges, series limits, trial counts, and concurrent tasks.
- Never infer that empty data means the metric does not exist until the query and labels are checked.
